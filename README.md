This is a simple file upload application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

To run the application, first install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Then, start the server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

The application will be running on port 3000. You can access the web interface at http://localhost:3000.

The application allows you to upload CSV files containing financial transactions. The data in the CSV file will be imported into a MongoDB database.

The application also provides a RESTful API that you can use to interact with the database. The API documentation is available at http://localhost:3000/api/docs.

Here are some code snippets that you may find helpful:

* The `db.js` file contains the code for connecting to the MongoDB database.
* The `model.js` file contains the schema for the MongoDB database.
* The `mon.js` file contains the code for processing the uploaded CSV file and importing the data into the database.
* The `routes.js` file contains the code for the RESTful API.
* The `server.js` file contains the code for starting the server and routing requests to the appropriate handlers.

I hope this helps!
